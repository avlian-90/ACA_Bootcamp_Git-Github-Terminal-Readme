> # **My First Homework**

> ### I have learnt and done the following tasks:

- *I read the materials that was given to us.*
- *I worked with terminal, made folders, files, removed them.*
- *I installed git, gitbash, node.js.*
- *I signed up in github, made a repository for homeworks.*
- *I did my homework and pushed it to github repository.*
- *I connected to Google Classroom and linked my homework there.*

It helps me to make this readme file the ***[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)***.
